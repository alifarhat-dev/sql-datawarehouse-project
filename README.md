The data architecture for this project follows the Medallion Architecture with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:  

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.  
2. **Silver Layer**: Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## üìñ Project Overview  

This project involves:  

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (**Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold**).  
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.  
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.  
4. **Data Exploration**: Performing exploratory analysis to identify data quality issues, uncover trends, and validate business logic.  
5. **Advanced Data Analytics**: Applying SQL-based advanced analytics (window functions, CTEs, aggregations, ranking, cohort analysis, etc.) to generate deeper insights beyond basic reporting.  
6. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable business insights.
